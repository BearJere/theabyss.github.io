The website for the text-based game ABYSS. Created by BearJere and Wumqus.

## To-Do:

* Create "ABYSS" text next to logo on top left and when clicked, it brings to home page
* Adjust logo position such that it is a little more to the left and down
* Create actual logo (Pac-Man is temporary) (Ask Jo for help with logo :O)
* Create actual "console" and game
* For contacts, translate youtube logo downwards relative to h1, looks off currently
